# Kanban Tasker

This Windows 10 Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application uses a kanban board as a simple workflow visualization tool and allows dragging of individual tasks and multiple project boards with syncing to OneDrive.

## Kanban Tasker Details

Created with C#/XAML and the Windows 10 Universal Windows Platform. The UI is created with Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) and backend is using C#. 

*New Screenshots Coming Soon

Uses a kanban control created by [Syncfusion](https://www.syncfusion.com) fully customized to Kanban Taskers style (see corresponding data templates in *BoardView.xaml, and App.xaml*). Also implemented with a Sqlite database to store the tasks/boards and uses create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations against the database.

Available in the microsoft store: https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NMKTDZ3L9LQ

#### Simple design with a popout pane to edit and create your tasks
 * Quick access to the pane comes from hovering over the task with your mouse and selecting the edit icon
   *  If light-holding the task on tablet mode and it does not register and open a context menu, right-click is enabled to work for the menu for editing or deleting.
 * Tags in the pane can range in width and height. If the tag is longer than the width of the pane, it will wrap to a new row and  increase the height

## Getting Started

### Developing & Debugging

The program requires a license from Syncfusion to debug since the Kanban Control is a control used by them, but they provide a free community license here: https://www.syncfusion.com/products/communitylicense

Generate a key for the UWP controls and head to App.xaml.cs and add your key into the string "YOUR_API_KEY". 

### Database generated by sqlite

You can view the .db file generated by sqlite with https://sqlitebrowser.org/

* The database file, .db, will be located in your ***Users->AppData (Make sure hidden items is on)->Local->Packages->(Search for db name)***
  * The database name is **ktdatabase.db**
  * All database work is handled and located located in *DataProvider.cs*
* Sqlite Browser should open automatically to your user profile. Navigate to View and select the checkbox to view ***Hidden Items*** so that App Data will show (if not showing already)

### Prerequisites

Due to the requirements for certain Windows 10 effects and controls used, the minimum version required to debug and run the application is **1809**

Minimum version: Windows 10, Version 1809

Target Version: Windows 10, Version 1903

#### Nuget Packages Required:

* Microsoft Sqlite should be installed on your system by default. So, the nuget package *"Microsoft.Data.Sqlite"* or *"Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.Core"* will work 

* *SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_winsqlite3* 

* *Syncfusion.SfKanban.UWP* package should be installed
